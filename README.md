## Features

On user access, Clicky Game presents the 12 cat cards in a random order. On user click, a point is added to the score if the user has not clicked that cat card before, the banner tells them they have guessed correctly, and the cards are reshuffled. If the user clicks a cat they have selected before, the banner tells them they have guessed incorrectly, and the game starts over and records a new high score if appropriate.
